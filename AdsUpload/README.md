## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### User Authentication
1. User visits app → redirected to `auth.html`
2. Firebase Google Sign-In (handled via `auth.html`)
3. After auth, redirected back to `index.html`
4. Email verified against `AUTHORIZED_EMAIL`

### Dropbox OAuth
1. User clicks "Upload All"
2. App checks for stored access token
3. If expired → automatically refreshes using refresh token
4. If no token → redirects to Dropbox OAuth login
5. User authorizes → receives tokens
6. Tokens stored in localStorage

---

## 📤 Upload Flow

```
User selects files
    ↓
Drag & drop OR click browse
    ↓
Files added to queue
    ↓
Click "Upload All"
    ↓
Get valid Dropbox token (refresh if needed)
    ↓
FOR EACH FILE:
  1. Upload to Dropbox (to /ads/{type}/{timestamp}_{filename})
  2. Create shareable link (public access)
  3. Save metadata to Firebase (fileName, size, link, timestamp)
    ↓
Show results with download links
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot GET /AdsUpload/oauth-callback.html"
**Solution:** Ensure redirect URI in Dropbox Console matches:
- For Local: `http://localhost:5500/AdsUpload/oauth-callback.html`
- For Production: `https://yourdomain.com/AdsUpload/oauth-callback.html`

### "client secret is missing"
**Solution:** Either:
1. Add client secret to `dropbox-config.js`
2. Or enter it when prompted in browser

### "Token refresh failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Check Dropbox app scopes are correct
2. Verify Client ID and Secret are valid
3. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
4. Re-authenticate

### Files not appearing in database
**Solution:**
1. Check Firebase credentials in `index.html`
2. Verify Dropbox upload succeeded (check results)
3. Check Firebase rules allow read/write for your email

## 📊 Storage Keys

### localStorage Keys (Browser)
- `dropbox_access_token` - Short-lived access token (~4 hours)
- `dropbox_refresh_token` - Long-lived refresh token (months)
- `dropbox_token_expiry` - Token expiration timestamp

### Dropbox Paths
- `/ads/all/` - All file types
- `/ads/banner/` - Banner images
- `/ads/fullimage/` - Full-size images
- `/ads/video/` - Video files

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Client Secret**: For production, never commit to GitHub
2. **HTTPS Only**: Use HTTPS in production (not just localhost)
3. **Email Verification**: Currently restricted to `ugomartinsdegreat@gmail.com`
4. **Token Storage**: Refresh tokens stored in localStorage (not encrypted)
5. **CORS**: Dropbox API calls use Bearer token headers

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Token Storage**: Your Pcloud access token is stored in browser's localStorage. This is relatively safe for personal use but consider the security implications for shared computers.

2. **HTTPS Recommended**: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

3. **Token Permissions**: Create Pcloud API tokens with minimal required permissions (file upload only).

4. **Token Rotation**: Regularly update your API token for enhanced security.

5. **File Validation**: The application accepts all file types. Implement server-side validation if needed.

## Frontend CDN Dependencies

This application uses the following CDN-hosted library:

- **Axios** (v1.6.0): HTTP client for API requests
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.6.0/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
  ```

## File Structure

```
AdsUpload/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file with structure
├── styles.css          # CSS styling and animations
├── app.js              # JavaScript application logic
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Technical Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and file input handling
- **CSS3**: Grid, flexbox, gradients, animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript ES6+**: No frameworks or build tools required
- **Axios**: HTTP requests to Pcloud API
- **Pcloud API**: Cloud storage backend

## Features in Detail

## Expiration / Time Limit

When creating or uploading an ad you can now specify an expiration period in days. The "Expire After (days)" field appears alongside the redirect link input. Ads with a positive number of days will automatically be marked with an `expiresAt` timestamp in Firebase. The mobile app filters out expired ads and any expired item is clearly indicated in the database view (with a red "expired" label). Set the value to `0` for no expiration.

The upload UI also shows the expiration date in the results list once the upload completes.

### Drag and Drop
- Visual feedback when dragging files over the upload area
- Support for multiple files in a single drag-drop operation

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress bar during upload
- Percentage display
- Individual file status tracking

### Result Management
- Success/error status for each uploaded file
- Maintains history of last 50 uploads
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Responsive Design
- Works seamlessly on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Mobile-optimized layout

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid Pcloud access token"
- Verify your access token is correct
- Check that your token hasn't expired
- Generate a new token from Pcloud Developer Console

### Issue: Files fail to upload
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the target folder ID exists in your Pcloud account
- Ensure you have enough storage space on Pcloud
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Issue: Configuration not saving
- Ensure localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Check if you're in private/incognito mode (localStorage may be disabled)
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Drag and drop not working
- Make sure you're using the application over HTTP/HTTPS
- File:// protocol has limitations with drag-drop

## Performance Tips

1. **Batch Uploads**: Upload multiple files at once rather than individually
2. **File Size**: While there's no strict limit in the UI, Pcloud may have limits
3. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache periodically for better performance

## API Rate Limiting

Pcloud may have rate limiting on their API. If you encounter rate limit errors:
- Wait a few seconds before retrying
- Reduce the number of simultaneous uploads
- Contact Pcloud support for higher limits
